# ðŸ¦€ Rust By Example

Repository for the code examples of
[rustbyexample.io](https://rustbyexample.io). Rust by Example aims to be an
introduction to the Rust programming language, and a companion for you to
reference as you learn Rust.

This project is heavily inspired by the amazing work of [Mark
McGranaghan](https://markmcgranaghan.com) and [Eli
Bendersky](https://eli.thegreenplace.net) on [Go By
Example](https://gobyexample.com).
